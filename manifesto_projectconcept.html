<h1> Manifesto Project Concept</h1>
<h4>September 11, 2025</h4>
<br>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p> Early 2025 egg prices surged and grocery store shelves were stripped. Shoppers competed for cartons as businesses and consumers faced economic hardship. The “egg crisis” came to an end, but there’s another cost to consider - that of the avian influenza. The egg crisis has laid bare the flaws in our food systems and the fragility of our economic and public health infrastructures. </p>
<br>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p> Chicken or the Egg is a short documentary film following New Yorkers as they navigate an egg crisis and its underlying root cause, the avian influenza. The film underscores the confusing intersection of public health, food chains, and economics, where it’s difficult to determine what should take priority. 
<br>
<br>
The film highlights our collective uncertainty and hopes to spark conversation and curiosity in the origins of our food and the treatment of animal and human health.
<br> 
<br>
Through this creative project, I am aiming to both enhance images inside the film to further visually underscore the aforementioned complexity and to make a companion site to the film, where viewers can engage more with political, educational, and economic debates surrounding eggs and the bird flu.
<br>
<br>
The site will be shared alongside the film as a resource for students, farmers, scientists, political activists, and the communities featured in the film. My hope is that this overall project is a dialectic and playful look at the situation, and that by adding a web component to the piece, I will allow the film’s viewers to more actively engage and consider the challenges the film proposes. 
<br>
<br>
The central visual metaphor of the project comes from the paradox in the film’s title - chicken or the egg. For the site, I plan to isolate chicken and egg imagery from the film and to then gamify the images with difficult choices about what to prioritize. I plan to alter existing images with yolky, eggy texture and components from microscopic slides of influenza viruses and to also create new images with scans of 3D printed models of H5N1 and repurposed archival imagery.

<br>
(The film is still in progress! I began working on this film in Documentary 2, and am now editing it in Documentary Editing)</p>
